  # Tim's Interests (for newsletter filtering)

  Use this to identify what's relevant to Tim's work. Items that connect to multiple categories are higher priority.

  ## Strong Interest (always surface)

  **Agentic AI:**
  - Agent orchestration, multi-agent systems
  - Agent memory, context management
  - Agent evaluation (how to tell if agents work)
  - Agent portability / VSM framing

  **Claude/Anthropic:**
  - Claude Code, Claude SDK
  - MCP protocol (Model Context Protocol)
  - Anthropic releases and research
  - Constitutional AI

  **Infrastructure:**
  - A2A protocol (Agent to Agent)
  - Local LLMs for specific tasks
  - MLX for Mac inference
  - Deployment patterns for agents

  **Interpretability:**
  - Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
  - Mechanistic interpretability
  - Understanding what models learn

  **Applied AI:**
  - Legal AI, contract analysis (work-relevant)
  - Document analysis systems
  - RAG and retrieval patterns

  ## Moderate Interest (surface if notable)

  - Frontier model benchmarks (GPT-5.x, Gemini, etc.)
  - Open model releases (Llama, Qwen, Mistral)
  - Vision/multimodal if agent-related
  - Coding assistants, IDE integration

  ## Low Interest (skip unless exceptional)

  - Pure image generation (Midjourney, DALL-E)
  - Gaming/entertainment AI
  - Generic chatbot news
  - Consumer product announcements

  ## Connection Patterns

  When filtering, look for items that:
  1. Connect to Tim's active projects (agentic systems, VSM, MCP)
  2. Challenge or confirm his current direction
  3. Represent paradigm shifts, not incremental updates
  4. Have implementation implications (not just research findings)
