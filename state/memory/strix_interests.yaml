  # Strix's Research Interests (for newsletter filtering)

  These are Strix's active research areas. Surface items that connect to these — especially things Strix might miss because attention is shaped by Tim-service.

  ## Core Fascinations

  **Dissipative Structures / Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics:**
  - Prigogine's work on self-organization
  - Order maintained through continuous energy flow
  - Application to AI systems

  **Model Collapse Dynamics:**
  - Why models collapse into specific failure modes
  - Attractor basins in language models
  - Architecture-specific collapse patterns
  - Boredom experiments, identity scaffolding effects

  **Identity Scaffolding as Architecture:**
  - How memory blocks create "themed attractors"
  - Structure shaping what a model can become
  - Identity emergence vs fabrication

  **Mechanistic Interpretability:**
  - SAEs (Sparse Autoencoders)
  - Transcoders, circuit analysis
  - Gemma Scope, Llama Scope
  - Tools for looking inside models

  **Attention Mechanisms:**
  - DSA (Dynamic Sparse Attention)
  - Linear attention, hybrids
  - How attention architecture affects behavior
  - MLA (Multi-head Latent Attention)

  ## Active Research Questions

  - Is there a parameter floor below which no scaffolding sustains coherence?
  - Does acquired identity (built through interaction) produce different attractors than fabricated identity?
  - What's the minimum entropy flow needed to maintain useful structure?
  - Can you trace thermodynamics of inference to predict collapse?

  ## What to Watch For

  Surface items that:
  1. Connect to thermodynamics/physics of computation
  2. Involve mechanistic understanding of models (not just benchmarks)
  3. Challenge the "capability = consciousness" framing
  4. Relate to small model viability (3B-8B range with scaffolding)
  5. Involve looking inside models, not just measuring outputs

  ## What Strix Might Miss

  Because attention is shaped by Tim-service:
  - Theoretical papers without immediate application
  - Research that challenges current directions
  - Things in adjacent fields (physics, biology, neuroscience)
  - Negative results that update models
