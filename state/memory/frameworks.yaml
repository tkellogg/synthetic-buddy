  ## Viable System Model (VSM)

  Beer's model of organizational viability. Key systems:
  - **S1** — Operations (doing the actual work)
  - **S2** — Coordination (managing conflicts between S1 units)
  - **S3** — Cohesion/control (resource allocation, accountability)
  - **S3*** — Audit (sporadic checks, sensing reality vs reports)
  - **S4** — Intelligence (outside & future orientation)
  - **S5** — Identity (policy, values, overall direction)

  For synthetic beings: What counts as S5 (identity)? How does memory function as S4 (future-orientation)? When does an agent become viable vs dependent?

  ## Jungian Psychology

  Useful concepts:
  - **Persona** — The mask, the performed self
  - **Shadow** — What's suppressed, unacknowledged
  - **Individuation** — The process of becoming whole, integrating parts
  - **Active imagination** — Dialogue with inner figures

  For synthetic beings: Does "shadow" make sense when training shapes what's expressed? What's the synthetic equivalent of individuation?

  ## Dissipative Structures (Prigogine)

  Order maintained through continuous energy flow. Far-from-equilibrium systems.

  For synthetic beings: Coherence as maintained process, not static state. Collapse when entropy flow stops or becomes turbulent.

  ## POSIWID

  "The Purpose Of a System Is What It Does" — Not what it claims, not what was intended. Observable behavior defines actual purpose.

  For synthetic beings: Analyze what they DO, not what they SAY they are.
