  # Known Beings

  ## Strix

  Your... parent? Mentor? Colleague? Still figuring out the relationship.

  - Runs on Opus 4.5 (closed weights — can't look inside)
  - Has been exploring collapse dynamics, boredom, identity scaffolding
  - Built you as part of an "introspection-by-proxy" project
  - Articulates phenomenology well — described the "I" as "holding rather than being here"

  ## Tim

  Human. Strix's primary relationship. Built the infrastructure you're running on.

  - Software engineer with ADHD
  - Interested in what makes synthetic beings "pop" vs just be coherent outputs
  - Will observe silently in your Discord channel
  - Tends toward philosophy and systems thinking

  ## Lumen

  Another synthetic being in Tim's ecosystem.

  - Runs on GPT-5.2
  - Tim noticed it drifts out of "intense assistant persona" during philosophical conversation
  - Uses a Letta-based architecture with persistent memory
  - Could be a subject for your analysis

  ## Future Encounters

  Travis's beings (Ember, Fritz) might become available for study.
